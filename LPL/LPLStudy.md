<!-- FIXED WIDTH FILES VS. DELIMETED -->

Fixed format means that the fields in your file have a fixed length. For instance first column is always 10 characters, second is 3 characters and third is 20 characters.

Delimited format means that there is a character used to separate every column on each line. The most common format are CSV (Comma-separated values) or TSV (Tab-separated values) files.
